# ibdiscordbot
This is a discord bot!

It functions through the use of javascript code. After being  added to a discord server, the bot waits for a user interaction with / commands. When the user gives a command, based on what the command is, the bot will perform a certain  function. This is the first version of the bot.I believe we had some struglled getting all of the code to work, which is why we moved to a python tutorial for the discord bots (and thus this one was sad as it was left behind).
